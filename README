If you're trying to diagnose a problem on a server and "dmesg" tells you 
something interesting (e.g. oom-killer, nfs problems, eth problems) but you 
want to know if the messages are recent or from weeks ago but it's hard to tell 
at a glance because dmesg tells you when it happened with a number meaning
"seconds since boot". This script reads the output of dmesg and prefixes each 
line with a time like "2012-05-10 22:33:57 " which is the "seconds since boot" 
added to the boot time.
